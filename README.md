# course_tracker

The system allows students to find and share reviews and resources regarding courses that the university offers, so it can help them decide which course to opt for.
Each course review consists of a written feedback and a 5-star rating, which are displayed on the system for other students to see. Resources are added in the form of a link along with its description.
Administrators can add courses and manage which reviews and resources are displayed to the students. The history of these actions are also saved to reevaluate and undo the changes.
